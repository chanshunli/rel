Relational Algebra in Clojure
-----------------------------

Implementation of the relational operators: projection, selection,
crossproduct, join, union, difference and intersection. There are
currently 2 different implementations, one with clojure sets and one
which generates and queries an sql database.

See also some example code in hoeck/rel/test.clj

to use it in clojure, copy the whole hoeck directiory to your
classpath and then simply do a (require 'hoeck.rel) or (use
'hoeck.rel). The interface is defined (and documented) in
hoeck/rel.clj.
