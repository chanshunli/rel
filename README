Relational Algebra in Clojure
-----------------------------

Implementation of the relational operators: projection, selection (restriction),
crossproduct, join, union, difference and intersection.

See example code in hoeck/rel/reflection.clj

To use it in clojure, include this directiory to your
classpath and then simply do a (use 'hoeck.rel) and (require hoeck.rel.reflection).

Needs also some clojure.contrib modules and lazymap from kotarak 
(http://bitbucket.org/kotarak/lazymap/).
